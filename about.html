          Born in Latvia. Inspired by nature. Built for modern life.<br><br>
          We started with a mission to bring sauna culture into everyday routines â€” without compromising quality, space, or design. Every unit is crafted locally using natural materials, minimalist form, and efficient tech.

          Whether you're after a quiet moment alone or social sessions with friends, our builds are designed for comfort, longevity, and low-maintenance joy.
